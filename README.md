# motivateme-website
This is a fun website for the Final Project of CS50: Introduction to Computer Science.

Concept: This is a page where random people motivate each other by sharing motivational thoughts, quotes, ideas & stories. The user will be able to read recent post made by people all around the world. People can choose posting anonymous or they can opt for creating an account and post under their username.

Design:  The website has a minimalistic approach to design.  It contains three main pages: Login page, registering page and main page. The main page renders messages sent all across the web.  

Tools: For the implementation of this website I have used, HTML, CSS (w/ Bootstrap), SQLite3, Python 3, Jinja2.
